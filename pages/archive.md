** The text below can be edited in pages/archive.md ** 

<!-- Comment the text below using ctrl+' -->

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` (does not seem to work if the file is named something different) and includes the necessary front matter and text. 

All the posts should be shown on this page, but only the three most recent posts appear on the home page.
