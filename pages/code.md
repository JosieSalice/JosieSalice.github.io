<!-- Note: to add a new tab that would look like the team page, you need to create a html file (within the _layouts folder), a yml file (within _data) and a scss file (within _sass). You also need to edit assets/theme/css/main.scss and import the corresponding scss file. For example, for the code page, we had to add the following line (l.58): @import "_code";  -->

If you want to write something here, edit pages/code.md.
